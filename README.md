5. **Stopword Removal**: Remove common English stopwords using NLTK
6. **Stemming**: Reduce words to base form using Porter Stemmer

### Feature Engineering:

- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency

## 🧠 Technical Decisions & Thinking

### Why SVM?
- **Best F1-score**: Balances precision and recall optimally
- **High accuracy**: 98.6% on test set
- **Probabilistic output**: Provides confidence scores via CalibratedClassifierCV
- **Text classification**: SVMs excel at high-dimensional sparse data like TF-IDF vectors

### Why TF-IDF over Word Embeddings?
- **Interpretability**: TF-IDF weights are understandable and explainable
- **Lightweight**: No complex neural network training required
- **Effectiveness**: Captures spam-specific keywords and phrases
- **Performance**: Fast inference suitable for real-time applications

### Why Multiple Models?
- **Comparison**: Allows evaluation of different approaches
- **Robustness**: Ensures best model selection through data-driven approach
- **Flexibility**: All models saved for potential future use

### Why FastAPI over Flask/Django?
- **Performance**: Asynchronous capabilities for high-throughput
- **Type hints**: Better code documentation and IDE support
- **Auto docs**: Built-in API documentation
- **Modern**: Python 3.6+ async/await support

### Why Separate Frontend?
- **Separation of concerns**: Backend focuses on ML, frontend on UX
- **Caching**: Static files can be cached independently
- **Scalability**: Frontend can be served by CDN or separate server
- **Technology choice**: Allows different tech stacks if needed

### Why Docker?
- **Reproducibility**: Ensures consistent environment across systems
- **Deployment**: Easy to deploy on cloud platforms (Render, Heroku, etc.)
- **Isolation**: Dependencies don't conflict with system packages
